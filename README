Integrate is a simple continious integration script written in python,
read the code, it's pretty straight forward, every repo get's a config file see integrate.conf.sample.
it only works with node.js right now, but it would be easy to integrate anything you wanted.  
the script start.py duplicates the directory passed in on the command line into the 'running' directory
and runs the node script found in the config file that is in the root of the directory passed to the script
if you rerun start.py with a directory that is already "running" it will stop node, re-duplicate the files,
and rerun the node script.

two caveats, you need a link to node in the root of the integrate directory, i use a symlink.
the script tells if a "project" is already running based on the directory it's given, so
../project/../project and ../project are two different projects as far as the script is concerned but you will get 
folder name collisons in the working directory because they would both be named "project" and things probably get crazy

KEEP THE LAST FOLDER NAME UNIQUE, AND USE THE SAME PATH TO RESTART YOUR JOBS. 

It might seem shoddy, and I'll probably fix the script eventually but this works well for now.
